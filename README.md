# Fast Robotics 4160 
##### This course focuses on autonomous robots, in which we explore it through making an autonomous car ourselves. Each lab building off eachother and creating a learning environment that involves forces, sensors, adurinos, and embedded processors. We will endeaver in how to reduce noise in sensors, and using C to program our robots. Come and take a look at my expierence throughout the labs for this semester.
